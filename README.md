# Wusel

This is a heart project I have since I started programming.

A Wusel is a something between a simulation you can watch - like a glass full of ants -
but also something you can interact with like a Pet.

So it something between a Tamagotchi or a Sim from their respective game franchise.

This project also gave me many opportunities to try out various languages,
such as C#, C++, many Java attempts and also one Haskell attempt.
Though this Rust attempt for now should be the final one.

----

The state of this project can range between a neglected WIP or a weekends with many changes.
Stay curious.

## Compilation

This is a basic Rust with Cargo project for now. To make it run, hit in the root directory:

```bash
cargo run
```

----

## Current State of the project

On `cargo run`, currently it prints a very small cui simulation
of walking wusels who wants to meet each other.

### Current Project Structure

This is currently an ugly, monolithic one-file project with Cargo wrapped around.
